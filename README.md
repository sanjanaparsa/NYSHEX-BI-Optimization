Route Efficiency: Route A was the most utilized, while Route C underperformed.

Carrier Analysis: Carrier B outperformed others in both shipment volume and revenue.

Inspection Impact: Revenue was still generated from pending/failed inspections, requiring BI-driven adjustments.

Discount Strategies: Shipment mode (flight, road, ship) and product importance influenced discount allocations.

# Key Insights and Outcomes
Optimize Route Allocation: Focus on high-performing routes (e.g., Route A) and reconsider underperforming ones (e.g., Route C).

Enhance Carrier Performance: Strengthen partnerships with high-efficiency carriers (e.g., Carrier B).

Improve Inspection Processes: Use BI to track inspection failures and adjust revenue recognition policies.

Adjust Discount Strategies: Align discounts with shipment modes and product importance for better profitability.

Gender-based marketing involves Tailoring strategies based on purchasing patterns (women buy more, but men give higher ratings).

# Conclusion
By implementing Business Intelligence, NYSHEX can:
1. Increase operational efficiency through data-driven route and carrier optimization.
2. Reduce costs by refining discount structures and minimizing inspection-related revenue losses.
3. Enhance decision-making with real-time analytics and predictive insights.
4. Improve customer satisfaction by understanding purchasing behaviors and preferences.

This BI-driven approach ensures NYSHEX remains competitive in the dynamic shipping industry while fostering transparency, reliability, and growth.

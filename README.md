# NYSHEX-BI-Optimization
 Business Intelligence for New York Shipping Exchange (NYSHEX)
# Introduction
The New York Shipping Exchange (NYSHEX) is a digital platform designed to bring stability and efficiency to the container shipping industry by facilitating enforceable contracts between shippers and carriers. This project focuses on leveraging Business Intelligence (BI) tools and techniques to analyze NYSHEXâ€™s operational data, identify key challenges, and provide data-driven recommendations to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve decision-making
# Dataset & Tools
Data Sources:
Internal NYSHEX Transaction Data (shipping contracts, carrier performance, product types, routes, revenue)

External Data (UNCTAD, container tracking providers, government agencies, open data portals)
# Tools and Technologies Used:
Tableau (Primary BI tool for data visualization and SQL-based analysis)

SQL (Data querying and manipulation)

Excel (Data cleaning and preliminary analysis)

Visualization Tools (Bar graphs, pie charts, dashboards)
# Project Walkthrough
Problem Identification:

Challenges faced by NYSHEX (e.g., user adoption, data quality, cybersecurity, compliance).

Data Analysis:

Examined shipping performance, revenue trends, inspection results, and discount strategies.

Visualization & Insights:

Developed interactive dashboards to highlight key metrics (e.g., revenue by product, route efficiency, carrier performance).

Strategic Recommendations:

Provided actionable insights to optimize operations, increase profitability, and enhance customer satisfaction.

# Snapshot of Dashboard
Product Performance: Skincare products generated the highest revenue ($241,628).

Route Efficiency: Route A was the most utilized, while Route C underperformed.

Carrier Analysis: Carrier B outperformed others in both shipment volume and revenue.

Inspection Impact: Revenue was still generated from pending/failed inspections, requiring BI-driven adjustments.

Discount Strategies: Shipment mode (flight, road, ship) and product importance influenced discount allocations.

# Key Insights and Outcomes
Optimize Route Allocation: Focus on high-performing routes (e.g., Route A) and reconsider underperforming ones (e.g., Route C).

Enhance Carrier Performance: Strengthen partnerships with high-efficiency carriers (e.g., Carrier B).

Improve Inspection Processes: Use BI to track inspection failures and adjust revenue recognition policies.

Adjust Discount Strategies: Align discounts with shipment modes and product importance for better profitability.

Gender-based marketing involves Tailoring strategies based on purchasing patterns (women buy more, but men give higher ratings).

# Conclusion
By implementing Business Intelligence, NYSHEX can:
1. Increase operational efficiency through data-driven route and carrier optimization.
2. Reduce costs by refining discount structures and minimizing inspection-related revenue losses.
3. Enhance decision-making with real-time analytics and predictive insights.
4. Improve customer satisfaction by understanding purchasing behaviors and preferences.

This BI-driven approach ensures NYSHEX remains competitive in the dynamic shipping industry while fostering transparency, reliability, and growth.
